# Gltf-viewer in WebGL, Rust, WebAssembly


This is a rewrite from "https://github.com/bwasty/gltf-viewer" to a WebGL implementation.  It's more of a complete rewrite than modification at this point, but the original has the basic logical structure of Gltf parsing for guidance. I hadn't encountered the Gltf protocol until this project.
